This is my sweet simple jekyll powered Github pages blog!  I'm a packrat, so if you check out my [github repos](https://github.com/srmelody), it's kind of like taking a look at my garage :)  

I'm a simple person who likes having fun and writing code!  Over the years, I've gotten to build all kinds of interesting software and work with amazing people.  This blog is me sharing some of those stories!
